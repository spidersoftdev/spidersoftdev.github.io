We used to have Flash. To play video on the website, we had to convert it to weird Flash video format, leave mp4 for safety and hope that everything will work fine. Later on, when HTML5 became a industry standard, our live become some much easier.
In the theory VIDEO tag solves all out issues. When browser can handle webm (Chrome family) we play webm.</description></item><item><title>iframe won’t display content..</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/iframe-wont-display-content/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 09:40:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/iframe-wont-display-content/</guid><description>There is a website, with iframe.

is a another alternative to

&lt;a href="http://nginx.org">nginx&lt;/a>
. For me the biggest advantage is that it’s only one binary file to work with. It’s easy to run, setup and just “works”. It’s super modern – handles HTTP2 and automatic HTTPS encryption using let’s encrypt certificates. Obviously it has plenty of other features but we focus only on speed of deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iOS Device Screen Sizes</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/ios-device-screen-sizes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2014 05:24:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/ios-device-screen-sizes/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cheat-sheet-with-ios-device-screen-sizes">Cheat sheet with iOS Device Screen Sizes&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Phalcon is a new PHP Framework of my choice</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/phalcon-is-a-new-php-framework-of-my-choice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 07:11:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/phalcon-is-a-new-php-framework-of-my-choice/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m working on multiple PHP based projects. Most of them using

as a base framework. I mastered it into stage, where has no secrets for me. The problem is that I also know disadvantages of this bit outdated framework. Recently core
&lt;a href="http://ellislab.com/blog/entry/ellislab-seeking-new-owner-for-codeigniter">team announced&lt;/a>
that they are dropping future development so it means that CI is dead. Doesn’t mean that I don’t like it anymore. I just started looking for something new.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like CI because I got control over everything. Modern PHP frameworks trying to solve all problems for you. It’s amazing, but lack of control is what you don’t need in when you developing projects. What do you need it’s this easy flow during development process. Full control over your MVC structure, but also a lot of “help” from framework itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Top Screen Resolutions</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2013/top-screen-resolutions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 06:20:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2013/top-screen-resolutions/</guid><description>Quite often we are asking this simple question.
