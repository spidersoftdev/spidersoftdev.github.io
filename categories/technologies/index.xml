Long story short - we do have many inline editing features, especially elements like dates, which are pretty painful. HTML5 Introduced
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date">input type=date&lt;/a>
, which is good enough to cover most of the cases, and we no longer need ugly and slow &lt;code>.datepicker()&lt;/code> component from jQuery od 3rd party suppliers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you do have &lt;em>edit&lt;/em> you can use &lt;code>&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;date&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;yyyy-mm-dd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code> field, and a nice calendar will pop up.

One of the problems was that not all HTML code was correctly transferred to markup during the export. So I needed fix (replace) all pending &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://spidersoft.com.au&amp;quot;&amp;gt;spidersoft&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to [spidersoft](https://spidersoft.com.au).
What we need are just two simple regular expressions.
One to find links &amp;lt;a.*?href=&amp;quot;(.+?)&amp;quot;.*?&amp;gt;(.+?)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Second one to replace them in reverse order [$2]($1)

I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as “cloud” came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have been using them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly. But Docker — for some reason, I was avoiding it until this two years ago, when I started using it. Without too much trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But today, history is not about my love &amp;amp; hate relationship with Docker, but about deploying the GO application and VIPS library. A couple of problems appeared during the process, and it’s worth mentioning them for future generations because I could find much help around my issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PrestaShop margin size on delivery slips</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/prestashop-margin-size-on-delivery-slips/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 13:02:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/prestashop-margin-size-on-delivery-slips/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently one of my clients contacted me asking if I could make a change.

We used to have Flash. To play video on the website, we had to convert it to weird Flash video format, leave mp4 for safety and hope that everything will work fine. Later on, when HTML5 became a industry standard, our live become some much easier.
In the theory VIDEO tag solves all out issues.

Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is

&lt;a href="http://golang.org/">The Go Programming Language&lt;/a>
– so far I loved it. I figure out that I’ll push some code snippets from time to time.&lt;br>
Today I spend some time creating simple not ever crawler, but website fetcher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Idea is very simple – download page, run xpath query on it and spit out results. I was looking for decent xpath library for Go and couldn’t find any. I tried to use
&lt;a href="http://gopkg.in/xmlpath.v2">xmlpath&lt;/a>
but it sucks. I couldn’t even run queries like &lt;code>id('product-details')/div[@class='product-price']&amp;quot;&lt;/code> Then I found something nicer –
&lt;a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri">Gokogiri&lt;/a>
– which works pretty nicely, but – couldn’t find any examples except this
&lt;a href="https://www.moovweb.com/blog/gokogiri-the-best-way-to-parse-xml-in-go/">small article&lt;/a>

&lt;p>The only problem with running Gokogiri is that it uses &lt;code>libxml2&lt;/code> which is not a huge problem on Linux based systems, but on Mac OS X you have to install it via
&lt;a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew&lt;/a>
