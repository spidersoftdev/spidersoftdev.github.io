&lt;p>Ever been in that situation where you&amp;rsquo;ve built something cool in Docker and want to quickly show it to your client? Yeah, me too. Recently, I was wrapping up a database admin panel project and needed a way to let my client review it before the final deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My go-to solution used to be Ngrok. It works, but the free tier gives you random URLs that look like &lt;code>8f4d-192-158-1-38.ngrok.io&lt;/code>. Not very professional when sending to clients, right? Plus, these URLs change every time you restart the tunnel.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
