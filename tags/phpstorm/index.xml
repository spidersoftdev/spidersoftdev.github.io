One of the problems was that during the export not all HTML code was correctly transferred to markup. So I needed fix (replace) all pending [aaa](http://) to [aaa](http://).
What we need is just 2 simple regular expressions.
One to find links [(.+?)]((.+?))
Second one to replace them in reverse order [$2]($1)
You can run this in basically any IDE - Sublime will do the job, I was using PHPStorm</description></item></channel></rss>
