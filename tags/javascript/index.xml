We used to have Flash. To play video on the website, we had to convert it to weird Flash video format, leave mp4 for safety and hope that everything will work fine. Later on, when HTML5 became a industry standard, our live become some much easier.
In the theory VIDEO tag solves all out issues. When browser can handle webm (Chrome family) we play webm.</description></item><item><title>Australian postcode to state conversion</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/australian-postcode-to-state-conversion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 10:59:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/australian-postcode-to-state-conversion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I was working on a project, when I had super boring address form. I figure out that we need to help poor users fill boring forms, so made a little code snippet / function which gets postcode and returns state. Postcode ranges were taken from

I tried
&lt;a href="http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/collection-of-backbone-js-tutorials/" title="Collection of Backbone.js tutorials">Backbone.js&lt;/a>
 which is my opinion a little bit “to” complicated. Of course – you can do everything, but.. it was to much hassle with coding in details. Second approach was to
&lt;a href="http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/collection-of-knockout-js-tutorials/" title="Collection of Knockout.js tutorials">KnockoutJS&lt;/a>
 – this one is really nice but from the other hand – I didn’t have much on control on my code and details, but everything was really nice and sleek. So… Quite similar like with choosing PHP Framework. I wanted something which will do some job for me, but I also wanted to have control on everything. That’s why I chose CodeIgniter which was perfect for me. But… with JavaScript – Finally i funded:
&lt;a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS&lt;/a>
. Made by Google engineers – but super nice and sleek.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Collection of Knockout.js tutorials</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/collection-of-knockout-js-tutorials/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 01:08:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/collection-of-knockout-js-tutorials/</guid><description>&lt;p>

It is a true compiler for JavaScript. Instead of compiling from a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minimizes what’s left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls.
Google provides Closure Compiler Service which is web application to compile JavaScript, you can also use Java application or REST API.</description></item></channel></rss>
