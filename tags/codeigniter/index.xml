Installation on Linux boxes is pretty yeasy:
sudo pear channel-update pear.php.net yum install php-pear-PHP-CodeSniffer¬†php-phpunit-phpcpd On Mac OS X you have couple options. Pear or Homebrew:
brew install php-code-sniffer
And following that, on regular boxes CodeSniffer will be here:
/usr/share/pear/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards
on Mac OS CodeSniffer will be located here:
/usr/lib/php/pear/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards or‚Ä¶ /usr/local/Cellar/php-code-sniffer/1.5.6/CodeSniffer/Standards
CodeIgniter standard can be downloaded from this location¬†https://github.</description></item><item><title>PHPUnit and CodeIgniter 3.0</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/phpunit-and-codeigniter-3-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 22:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/phpunit-and-codeigniter-3-0/</guid><description>Quick tutorial how to setup proper unit testing with PHPUnit and CodeIgniter 3.0.
We need couple elements
CodeIgniter ‚Äì we are working with version¬†3.0rc3 PHPUnit ‚Äì latest one If you don‚Äôt have phpunit installed globally, you can go with composer, just add section to your composer.json
{ &amp;#34;require-dev&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;phpunit/phpunit&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;4.1.*&amp;#34; } } and then
composer.phar install
and after while we have
./vendor/bin/phpunit
working phpunit.
let‚Äôs create phpunit.xml.dist
next step will require create separate bootstrap file for PHPUnit.</description></item><item><title>CodeIgniter-minify update</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/codeigniter-minify-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 00:05:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/codeigniter-minify-update/</guid><description>Just introduce some new options to my quite popular library CodeIgniter-minify .

&lt;a href="https://github.com/slav123/CodeIgniter-Img">CodeIgniter img&lt;/a>
was updated. Purpose of this library is pretty clear ‚Äì to scale images on the fly using CodeIgniter. It‚Äôs very useful in all kinds of website and CMS-like projects. All you need to do, is just load library and inside view use it like that&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$this-&amp;gt;img-&amp;gt;rimg(&amp;#39;path/to/image.jpg&amp;#39;, array(&amp;#39;width&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; 100, &amp;#39;height&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; 200, &amp;#39;alt&amp;#39;=&amp;#39;my awesome image&amp;#39;));
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>First time when script hits image, will create thumbnail. Next time, website will get already scaled image. If you need change dimensions, just change it within view ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry about recreating images.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CodeIgniter and PHP_CodeSniffer</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/codeigniter-and-php_codesniffer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2012 08:28:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/codeigniter-and-php_codesniffer/</guid><description>CodeIgniter is the king üòâ But if we want to create good quality code, we should be aware about CodeIgniter style guide standards. What can be better than PHP_CodeSniffer for keeping our code¬†consistent¬†and clean as much as it possible.
Unfortunately standard rules from PHP_CodeSniffer doesn‚Äôt apply for CodeIgniter. You have to install additional set of rules ‚Äì you can download them from here: PHP_CodeSniffer rules for CI .</description></item><item><title>CodeIgniter Uploadify problem</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/codeigniter-uploadify-problem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 02:37:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/codeigniter-uploadify-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>I tried to implement Uploadify with

Library is based on excellent * Smarty plugin ‚ÄúThumb‚Äù * created in 2005 by Christoph Erdmann. This¬†version is a little different, we are using core from Thumb, and some modification which¬†gives more flexibility to work with it.
