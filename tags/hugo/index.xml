One of the problems was that during the export not all HTML code was correctly transferred to markup. So I needed fix (replace) all pending &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://spidersoft.com.au&amp;quot;&amp;gt;spidersoft&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to [spidersoft](https://spidersoft.com.au).
What we need is just 2 simple regular expressions.
One to find links &amp;lt;a.*?href=&amp;quot;(.+?)&amp;quot;.*?&amp;gt;(.+?)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
Second one to replace them in reverse order [$2]($1)</description></item><item><title>Clearing up git submodules problems</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/clearing-up-git-submodule-problem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 12:44:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/clearing-up-git-submodule-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>As some of you noted I moved by blog into

. During the build process you have to pull many git repositories to compile full project. Because begging are always hard. For me it&amp;rsquo;s always trial and error I ended up with having many sub-repositories missing. I’m not going to show whole journey how to solve “the issue”.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
