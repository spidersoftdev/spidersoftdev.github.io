I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as “cloud” came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have used them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly.

convert myfile.pdf[1] dc.jpg
number 1 in brackets means only one(second) page to process.
As I result I get file with pretty huge size: 496.</description></item></channel></rss>
