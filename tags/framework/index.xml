I tried
&lt;a href="http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/collection-of-backbone-js-tutorials/" title="Collection of Backbone.js tutorials">Backbone.js&lt;/a>
 which is my opinion a little bit “to” complicated. Of course – you can do everything, but.. it was to much hassle with coding in details. Second approach was to
&lt;a href="http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/collection-of-knockout-js-tutorials/" title="Collection of Knockout.js tutorials">KnockoutJS&lt;/a>
 – this one is really nice but from the other hand – I didn’t have much on control on my code and details, but everything was really nice and sleek. So… Quite similar like with choosing PHP Framework. I wanted something which will do some job for me, but I also wanted to have control on everything. That’s why I chose CodeIgniter which was perfect for me. But… with JavaScript – Finally i funded:
&lt;a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS&lt;/a>
. Made by Google engineers – but super nice and sleek.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most complete Twitter Bootstrap PSD template</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/moste-complete-twitter-bootstrap-psd-template/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 10:11:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2012/moste-complete-twitter-bootstrap-psd-template/</guid><description>Twitter Bootstrap revolutionised work of backend developer.

Which is basically great CSS framework. Light, quick in development and good looking. In last days I just discover great based starter theme based on this CSS framework – check it out Foundation for WordPress or just download directly from GitHub</description></item><item><title>CodeIgniter OpenSource Web Application Framework</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2010/codeigniter-opensource-web-application-framework/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2010 10:09:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2010/codeigniter-opensource-web-application-framework/</guid><description>&lt;p>For many years we was searching for for really good
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework">framework&lt;/a>
for our application core. After trying
&lt;a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework&lt;/a>
which is really power-full, but quite heavy for regular use, we tried to use some lighter –
&lt;a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP&lt;/a>
which is better, but still many solutions are to complicated for real rapid development and freedom, we found what we are looking for –
&lt;a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter&lt;/a>
