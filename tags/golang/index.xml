I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as ‚Äúcloud‚Äù came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have used them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly. But Docker ‚Äî for some reason, I was avoiding it until this two years ago, when I started using it. Without too much trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But today, history is not about my love &amp;amp; hate relationship with Docker, but about deploying the GO application and VIPS library. A couple of problems appeared during the process, and it‚Äôs worth mentioning them for future generations because I could find much help around my issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quickest in-house HTML to PDF solution</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/quickest-in-house-html-to-pdf-solution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 12:44:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/quickest-in-house-html-to-pdf-solution/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can find some online APIs and use the free tier to test them, but you can make them your own.

Flow is pretty simple, but we have a couple of components.
We need something to ‚Äúreceive‚Äù emails. The easiest way is to use Amazon SES or mailgun or‚Ä¶ something else. There are a couple of SASS solutions for that. Next step is to be notified when the email arrives, so we don‚Äôt have overhead with checking email every couple of minutes We have to ‚Äúdecompose‚Äù ‚Äì decode email from it‚Äôs raw format to text, and attachments.</description></item><item><title>Binary compression still alive ‚Äì golang binary compression.</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/binary-compression-still-alive-golang-binary-compression/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:34:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/binary-compression-still-alive-golang-binary-compression/</guid><description>In the ancient times, when I was coding mostly in Pascal ‚Äì size did matter. People were using RAR to shave couple kilobytes from archives, and having 2mb executable was better then having 4mb executable file. In that beautiful time we used¬†UPX ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt aware that this project is still alive, and works nicely with binaries create bo go lang.

Amazon is super simple, and developer friendly ‚Äì Google‚Ä¶ well not so easy. So the questions ‚Äì why you may consider using GS instead of well documented, and super easy S3. Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is
&lt;a href="http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/amazon-s3-azure-and-google-cloud-prices-compare/">actually cheaper&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="http://golang.org/">The Go Programming Language&lt;/a>
‚Äì so far I loved it. I figure out that I‚Äôll push some code snippets from time to time.&lt;br>
Today I¬†spend some time creating simple not ever crawler, but website fetcher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Idea is very simple ‚Äì download page, run xpath query on it and spit out results. I was looking for decent xpath library for Go and couldn‚Äôt find any. I tried to use
&lt;a href="http://gopkg.in/xmlpath.v2">xmlpath&lt;/a>
but it sucks. I couldn‚Äôt even run queries like &lt;code>id('product-details')/div[@class='product-price']&amp;quot;&lt;/code> Then I found something nicer ‚Äì
&lt;a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri">Gokogiri&lt;/a>
‚Äì which works pretty nicely, but ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt find any examples except this
&lt;a href="https://www.moovweb.com/blog/gokogiri-the-best-way-to-parse-xml-in-go/">small article&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem with running Gokogiri is that it uses &lt;code>libxml2&lt;/code> which is not a huge problem on Linux based systems, but on Mac OS X you have to install it via
&lt;a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew&lt;/a>
&lt;br>
&lt;code>brew install libxml2&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
