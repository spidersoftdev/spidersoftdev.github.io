There is a couple SASS solutions for that Next step is to be notified when email arrive, so we don‚Äôt have overhead with checking email every couple of minutes We have to ‚Äúdecompose‚Äù ‚Äì decode email from it‚Äôs raw format to text, and attachments.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with AWS CLI</title><link>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2017/getting-started-with-aws-cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 07:25:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2017/getting-started-with-aws-cli/</guid><description>&lt;p>AWS has extremely nice UI.
