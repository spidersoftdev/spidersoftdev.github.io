The answer isn’t simple – it depends. Usually, we have couple components which are critical for the whole system. If we are talking about a web-based solution or any API we have to decide about DATABASE, then we have STORAGE, moving on – some BACKEND service language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How slow is FOUND_ROWS function in MySQL</title><link>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2016/how-slow-is-found_rows-function-in-mysql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2016 04:15:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2016/how-slow-is-found_rows-function-in-mysql/</guid><description>&lt;p>From many different reasons I was always using 
&lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-functions.html#function_found-rows">SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS&lt;/a>
to get total number of records, when i was running limited query. Never especially thought about it, until i had some super performance issues with one of my projects. Obviously after quick profiling and googling  i found
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186588/which-is-fastest-select-sql-calc-found-rows-from-table-or-select-count">people complaining about FOUND_ROWS() low performance&lt;/a>
. I wasn’t aware how big impact it was until i tested.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MongoDB vs MySQL using golang</title><link>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/mongodb-vs-mysql-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 04:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/mongodb-vs-mysql-using-golang/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m the guy who like to test. Benchmark is my… middle name. You can find dozens articles about speed one or other solution. I mean
&lt;a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL&lt;/a>
. I tried MongoDB couple times, and each time I wasn’t  moved by it speed. Got project coming in, when I have to deal with large amount of concurrent connection. It’s not very big, but bigger then casual MySQL load.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So… how did I test – very dump way. Got 2 tables, one around 11k records, second one close to 200k record. Not much. Fields were indexed in both MySQL and MongoDB. And then i run benchmarks. First one had string fields, second one numeric.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MySQL on Mac OS X with preference panel</title><link>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2010/mysql-on-mac-os-x-with-preference-panel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2010 10:06:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.spidersoft.com.au/2010/mysql-on-mac-os-x-with-preference-panel/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my daily work I really suffered because MySQL wasn’t work after fresh installation. Preference panel just didn’t start MySQL on system startup neither using it into Preferences.&lt;br>
After a lot of google research I found many solutions but only

gives me some clues how to find proper fix.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
