Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is
&lt;a href="http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/amazon-s3-azure-and-google-cloud-prices-compare/">actually cheaper&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/storage/">Google Storage for Developers&lt;/a>

It is a true compiler for JavaScript. Instead of compiling from a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minimizes what’s left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls.
Google provides Closure Compiler Service which is web application to compile JavaScript, you can also use Java application or REST API.</description></item></channel></rss>
