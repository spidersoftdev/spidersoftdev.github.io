We need something to render a page because, nowadays, almost all pages are rendered with the help of JavaScript. Moving on, we also need something to talk to the browser. Because our browser is headless, we need to use some API. And finally, we need to save the result. Getting a result is tricky because browsers are designed to interact with rendered results rather than directly with the source code.</description></item><item><title>Docker, GO and CGO application build</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/docker-go-cgo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 06:16:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2021/docker-go-cgo/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been avoiding Docker for a very long time. I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as “cloud” came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have used them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly. But Docker — for some reason, I was avoiding it until this two years ago, when I started using it. Without too much trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But today, history is not about my love &amp;amp; hate relationship with Docker, but about deploying the GO application and VIPS library. A couple of problems appeared during the process, and it’s worth mentioning them for future generations because I could find much help around my issues.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
