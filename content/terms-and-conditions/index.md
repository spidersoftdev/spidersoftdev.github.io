#### Software Project Development Procedure

With help and input from the Client, SpiderSoft will develop the contracted scope of the software project. Before work may begin on a project, the Client must sign the project acceptance agreement and electronically accept these Terms of Service. Client may submit their design survey to SpiderSoft through SpiderSoft&#8217;s online design survey application.

In submitting the survey, links to sample sites the Client likes are for general information purposes only and assist SpiderSoft with the design of the Client&#8217;s custom website or software. The functionality and detail of the sample sites will not be duplicated unless such functionality and detail are specifically included and itemized in SpiderSoft&#8217;s proposal and Project Specifications Summaries and do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.

SpiderSoft will not be held liable for accuracy of information, typos, or spelling errors in any of the content approved by the Client and published on the website. Client will be notified by email when the website is live.

#### Completion Timeframes

Client understands, agrees and acknowledges that SpiderSoft does not guarantee a time frame for completion of ANY website or software project. This is in part because it is difficult to complete a projct without design and functionality approvals and participation from the Client. In addition, if the Client continues to submit additional content throughout the development process, or requests additional modifications to the project, the completion time frame is increased. Other factors that may influence the completion date of a project include, but are not limited to, complexity of Client&#8217;s project(s), availability of SpiderSoft personnel, accounting status of Client&#8217;s account, etc.

If Client does not respond to SpiderSoft communications and, as a result, SpiderSoft is not able to start or complete the website/software project, Client is still responsible for all fees incurred including, but not limited to, design purchase price, set-up fees, enhancements purchased and monthly hosting charges that begin accruing from date of sale. If Client&#8217;s website/software requires custom programming, functionality, flash, e-commerce or the use of a database, the overall development time will be extended.

#### Expedited Services

While SpiderSoft does not guarantee a time frame for the completion of any custom website or software project, it may offer an optional expedited service to Client for a fee. Expedited service is not available for all accounts and all requests for expedited service must be approved by SpiderSoft at its sole discretion. Client understands and agrees that Client&#8217;s use of expedited service does not guarantee that Client&#8217;s website / software including its corresponding design, enhancements, databases, e-commerce stores, flash, etc, will be completed more quickly than they would be without the use of the expedited service. The expedited service fee only ensures that SpiderSoft will make reasonable efforts to more quickly assign designers and programmers to the account in an effort to facilitate development than would be the case under the ordinary developmental process.

The successful use of expedited service is contingent upon Client&#8217;s timely acceptance of the Terms of Service, payment of any and all fees due, submission of content through the online web center and acceptance of any project specification documents prepared by SpiderSoft and Client&#8217;s timely cooperation with SpiderSoft in any solicitation for information related to the website / software&#8217;s development.

If expedited service is offered to Client by SpiderSoft, Client may be presented with an estimated date of completion. Client understands and agrees that such estimated dates of completion are estimates only and may apply only to one particular element of the project, i.e. database, flash, e-commerce, design, programming and not necessarily to multiple elements of the website or to the website collectively. Under no circumstances will SpiderSoft guarantee the respective portion or portions of the website / software subject to the estimated date of completion to be completed sooner than the estimated date of completion. Should circumstances arise that make it impossible to complete the portion or portions of the website / software that are subject to the estimated date of completion by the estimated date of completion, including but not limited to Client failure to provide SpiderSoft with requested information in a timely manner, SpiderSoft reserves the right to change the estimated date of completion accordingly or to cancel the expedited services and refund a portion of the expedited service fee to Client. In no case shall the portion of the expedited service fee to be refunded be greater than fifty percent (50%) of the expedited service fee. Regardless of whether work is completed by the estimated date of completion, Client remains liable to SpiderSoft for any and all other charges related to the website / software&#8217;s development.

#### Cancellation Fee and Refund Policy

Client agrees that all fees incurred and billed prior to cancellation effective date are valid and Client agrees to pay. Upon request for termination of services the website will be removed. A back-up copy of the website/software is not maintained by SpiderSoft.

#### Client Approval

This includes, but is not limited to, functionality of all website / software pages, programmed functionality, database, e-commerce store, payment functions, galleries, forums and other business software functionalities.

Client website / software design may be posted live as soon as the website design is completed by SpiderSoft and full design milestone payment is received from Client to SpiderSoft. Additional features, such as custom database programming, flash programming, etc., will be added to the site as they are completed. The website / software may be posted live within 30 days from purchase if SpiderSoft is required to complete content and design without complete Client input or content from Client.

The Client understands and agrees that if the Client does not respond within 5 business days to SpiderSoft&#8217;s request for approval and notification that the website / software has been completed and taken live, the website / software along with the functionality of the website / software and services rendered, will be deemed to be approved by the Client and Client agrees services have been rendered and the functionality of the website / software has been tested and approved by the Client.

The Client understands and agrees that if the Client does not respond to requests for missing information a final notification will be sent to the Client. If the Client does not respond within 5 business days to SpiderSoft&#8217;s notification or requests for missing information, the website / software, along with the functionality of the website / software and the services rendered, will be deemed to be approved by the Client, and the website / software will be taken live with the missing information &#8220;as-is&#8221; or &#8220;under construction&#8221;.

In the event that SpiderSoft completes all of the work per the original sale and database write ups, SpiderSoft reserves the right to move the site live and deem the work to be completed without Client&#8217;s permission if Client will not give approval of the work.

#### Scope Change Requests Before and After Website / Software Goes Live

SpiderSoft agrees to build a website / software to specifications quoted per the original proposal and original project specification document. Any additions or changes requested outside of the scope of the original sale, either prior to the custom website going live, or after the site has gone live, will be billed at SpiderSoft&#8217;s standard hourly rate. SpiderSoft is not obligated to complete Client requests or changes outside of the scope of work on the original proposal. If SpiderSoft does not agree to Client requests or changes, Client is still obligated to pay all fees incurred and due.
