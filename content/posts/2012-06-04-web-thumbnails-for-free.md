Taking snapshots of websites  &#8211; it&#8217;s very simple thing, but &#8230; you need to install an browser extension &#8211; I&#8217;m using [Awesome Screenshot](http://awesomescreenshot.com/), or use magic shortcut in Mac OS X. You can also take advantage of services specializing in this task, but as far as I know there are not many free solutions. So today I will describe the project [webthumbnail.org](http://webthumbnail.org/)</a>.</

The idea is very simple &#8211; generate snapshots of the page at any resolution, we can choose between several browsers (Chrome, FireFox, Opera). Service itself has  simple interface, a web application also allows you to use the API. Everything works very simply and very quickly. I just hope it does not run out of resources and the desire to keep the application live.
