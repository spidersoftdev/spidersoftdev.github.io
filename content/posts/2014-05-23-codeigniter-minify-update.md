Just introduce some new options to my quite popular library [CodeIgniter-minify][1]. From now one you can chose CSS compression engine (cssmin || minify), also FORCE rewrite CSS files. Some speed improvements were also made.

Please feel to checkout library on GitGub &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/slav123/CodeIgniter-minify" target="_blank">CodeIgniter-minify</a>
