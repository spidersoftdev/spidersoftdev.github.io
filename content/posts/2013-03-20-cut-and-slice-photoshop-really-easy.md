This is one if these rare plugins which make my live lot easier. Actually can&#8217;t imagine my work without it. [Cut&Slice me](http://www.cutandslice.me/) is able to export your assets to different devices in seconds. Whole idea is really simple &#8211; name objects, or groups in special way. Click one button &#8211; and all assets will be exported in proper file names. It&#8217;s getting event better &#8211; his plugin is able to export all assets in multiple dimensions (retina images). So&#8230; if you ever dreamt about perfect tool for you work &#8211; this is it.
