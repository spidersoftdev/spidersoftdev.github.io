I was looking for some kind of easy to use Window Manager for Mac OS X. Usually I&#8217;m working on multiple screen with multiple application open (usually it&#8217;s between 4-8). It&#8217;s really hard to organise everything in proper order and placement. Arranging windows it&#8217;s slow, especially when you need to compare or see results on multiple window at once.

First choice was quite popular [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/), but as long as I&#8217;m always looking for cheaper alternative ($14 it&#8217;s not a lot, but always you can find some cheaper). I decided to look for an alternative solution. And I found it &#8211; it&#8217;s called [ShiftIt](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt#readme). It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s open source and it&#8217;s working. It&#8217;s hard to find download for [binaries](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/downloads).

It&#8217;s really simple, and it&#8217;s working &#8211; basically you have predefined shortcuts for placing window on the top/left/bottom/upper part of screen. You can also centre APP or expand it to full screen.
