&#8230;in most cases you have 2 options. Because we are living in Cloud and VPS era &#8211; it&#8217;s not a big deal. You can always bump up your volume and after while you can enjoy bigger more expensive instance with more space. But sometimes you need just a space for a while or&#8230; just something for a backup ? You can always use [s3cmd][0], [gsutil][1] or another tool. Imagine that you have just regular folder on your drive, with almost unlimited space. Sounds good ? If so checkout &#8211;Â [s3fs-fuse](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse). Nice tool, which allows you to bind external storage as a director in your system.
