[Google Cloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview)Â itâ€™s Google answer to \[Amazon S3\]\[1\]Â service. As long one of them is very popular ðŸ˜‰ Second wasnâ€™t so successful amongst developers due to quite complex processes around service. Amazon is super simple, and developer friendly â€“ Googleâ€¦ well not so easy. So the questions â€“ why you may consider using GS instead of well documented, and super easy S3. Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is [actually cheaper](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/amazon-s3-azure-and-google-cloud-prices-compare/). The other reason to use Google Storage is having different provider as a backup solution. Anyway â€“ letâ€™s show how easy is to use GS with existing S3 libraries.

Google wanted to steel some clients from Amazon and they introducedÂ [Google Cloud Storage Interoperability](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability)Â which is basically same API which AWS S3 has. Â According to [this document](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/migrating)Â there are couple differences, but in general they arenâ€™t â€“ except endpoint.

You have to enable it using Google Developers Console
