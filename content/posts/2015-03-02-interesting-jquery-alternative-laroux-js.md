If we are talking about [jQuery](http://jquery.com) alternatives there is not much on the market. With age jQuery put a little bit on weight, not mentioning it&#8217;s speed. If we are talking about weight and speed we have [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com) and&#8230; we can use pure JavaScript which isn&#8217;t especially convenient in larger  projects. But definitely it&#8217;s much more but&#8230; it&#8217;s faster.

Recently I found another project called &#8211; [laroux.js](https://larukedi.github.io/laroux.js/). Author says that&#8217;s is [much faster](https://larukedi.github.io/laroux.js/benchmarks.html) then jQuery or even Zepto giving convenience of nice API and modular build.
