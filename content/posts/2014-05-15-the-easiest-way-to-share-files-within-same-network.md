Sometimes you are just to lazy to copy files to local storage server. Sending files over email ? To long. What other options you have.

If you are on Mac &#8211; AirDrop is an answer but &#8211; you have to be on wireless. What if you are using old fashion cable ?

There is a solution for that &#8211; web experiment called <a href="https://www.sharedrop.io/" target="_blank">www.sharedrop.io</a>

> ShareDrop is a free app that allows you to easily and securely share files directly between devices in the same local network*, without having to upload them to any server first.

Pros:

  * fast,
  * easy to use

Cons:

  * works only on Chrome
