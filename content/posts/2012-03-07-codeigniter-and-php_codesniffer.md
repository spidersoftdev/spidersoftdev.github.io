[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) is the king ðŸ˜‰ But if we want to create good quality code, we should be aware about [CodeIgniter style guide](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/styleguide.html) standards. What can be better than [PHP_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/) for keeping our codeÂ consistentÂ and clean as much as it possible.

Unfortunately standard rules from PHP_CodeSniffer doesn&#8217;t apply for CodeIgniter. You have to install additional set of rules &#8211; you can download them from here: [PHP_CodeSniffer rules for CI](https://github.com/thomas-ernest/CodeIgniter-for-PHP_CodeSniffer).
