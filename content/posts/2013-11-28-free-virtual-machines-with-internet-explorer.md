[BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/) is well known service which provides awesome tools to test your website against different browsers and operating systems. It&#8217;s very handy when it comes to professional QA testing.

Not everyone knows, that from that place  you can also download virtual machines for free. On this page [Virtual Machine](http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads) you can pull multiple VM images with IE8 / IE 9 and different versions of windows.
