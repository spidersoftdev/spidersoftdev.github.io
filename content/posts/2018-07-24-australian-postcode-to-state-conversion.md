Recently I was working on a project, when I had super boring address form. I figure out that we need to help poor users fill boring forms, so made a little code snippet / function which gets postcode and returns state. Postcode ranges were taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_Australia), so blame them if something isn&#8217;t working as expected.
