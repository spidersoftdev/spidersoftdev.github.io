For many years we was searching for for really good [framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework) for our application core. After trying [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) which is really power-full, but quite heavy for regular use, we tried to use some lighter &#8211; [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) which is better, but still many solutions are to complicated for real rapid development and freedom, we found what we are looking for &#8211; [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) .

Why CodeIgniter is better then others ? Bacause is really fast, has really small footprint and is easy to extend. Recently CodeIgniter released 

[version 1.7.3](http://codeigniter.com/news/codeigniter_1.7.3_released/) of this extremely friendly solution.
