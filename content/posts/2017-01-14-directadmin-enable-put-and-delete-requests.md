Recently I&nbsp;realised that my [DirectAdmin](https://www.directadmin.com) hosting doesn&#8217;t support PUT and DELETE requests by default. Apparently it&#8217;s necessary to make requests to my recent [PrestaShop](https://www.prestashop.com/en/) API adventures. As usually quick and dirty solution below. All you need to do, just to drop it to custom configuration.

_admin&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;Custom Httpd Configurations_

Code:

```
<Limit GET POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS PROPFIND>
 Order allow,deny
 Allow from all
</Limit>
<LimitExcept GET POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS PROPFIND>
 Order deny,allow
 Deny from all
</LimitExcept>
```

Visual reference:

Or there is another way. You can use code below and use it as on image:

```
<directory home="" admin="" domains="" inter-idea.pl="" private_html="">
    AllowMethods GET HEAD POST OPTIONS DELETE PUT
</directory>
```
