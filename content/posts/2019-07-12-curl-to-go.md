Quite often we are looking for a quick way to make a request in GO, and we have working query tested in CURL. Sometimes it&#8217;s problematic to &#8220;move&#8221; all queries to GO, and build up whole query using client, protocol and so on. 

From the author of my beloved [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) server there is a tool called [curl-to-Go](https://mholt.github.io/curl-to-go/) which basically does what is says. Just paste your CURL request and GO lang code to implement that.

Same guy also written [JSON-to-GO](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/) &#8211; which converts JSON object to proper Struct in Go.
