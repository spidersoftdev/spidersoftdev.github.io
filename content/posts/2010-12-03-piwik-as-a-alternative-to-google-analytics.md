Piwik is a downloadable, open source (GPL licensed) real time web analytics software program. It provides you with detailed reports on your website visitors: the search engines and keywords they used, the language they speak, your popular pages… and so much more.  
It&#8217;s great free open source alternative for Google Analytics. It&#8217;s easier and more readably for regular user to understand traffic on your website.

What makes Piwik unique from the competition:

  * Real time web analytics reports: in Piwik, by default reports are generated in real time. For high traffic websites, you can choose the frequency for reports to be processed (more info)
  * Piwik&#8217;s features are built inside plugins: you can add new features and remove the ones you don’t need. If you are a developer, you can easily build your own web analytics plugins!
  * you own your data: because Piwik is installed on your server, the data is stored in your own database and you can get all the statistics using open APIs (publishing the data in many formats: xml, json, php, csv)
  * the user interface is fully customizable: you can drag and drop the widgets you want to display and create a report especially tailored to you!

Actually we are offering **hosted Piwik statics for free**. If your are interested contact with us, and we will send you code and access to your personal Piwik profile.
