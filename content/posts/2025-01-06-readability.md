I'd like to share [Readability][1], a tool I've developed and refined over time. Its primary focus has always been straightforward: find the most prominent image on any webpage while keeping the overhead minimal.

## Core Focus: Image Detection

The main strength of Readability lies in its image detection capabilities. While many similar tools try to do everything, I focused on solving one specific problem really well: finding the most prominent image on a page through dimensional analysis. The approach is simple yet effective:

1. Fetch all images from the page
2. Analyze their dimensions
3. Identify the largest one

This targeted approach has proven reliable across countless websites and use cases.

## Minimal Overhead, Maximum Insight

I've deliberately kept the tool lightweight. Instead of parsing entire DOM trees or running complex algorithms, Readability does just what's needed:

- Quick DOM traversal for content structure
- Efficient image size calculation
- Basic metadata extraction

The result is a fast, reliable tool that gives you exactly what you need without unnecessary processing.

## Clean JSON Output

Everything returns in a straightforward JSON format:

- Page title and metadata
- Success status
- Publication dates
- Lead image URL
- Content summary
- Domain information

## Common Use Cases

Over the years, users have successfully employed Readability for:

- Content aggregation platforms
- News scraping systems
- Research data collection
- Web archives
- Content analysis pipelines

## Getting Started

The project is documented at [Readability][1]. Its focused feature set and clean output format make it an excellent choice for projects requiring reliable image detection and content insights.

## Looking Forward

After years of refinement, Readability continues to do what it does best: find prominent images and extract key content insights with minimal overhead. If you need these capabilities in your project, check out the [full documentation][1].
