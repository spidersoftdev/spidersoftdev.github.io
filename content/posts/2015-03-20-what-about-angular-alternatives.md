1. [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) – i heard plenty of good thinks about this framework, for me the way we constructing and extending models it’s bit weird, but people like it 
2. [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) – looks very promising, it’s bit fresh so would give more time to see how project evolve, 
3. [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) – i really liked simplicity and very [short learning curve](http://learn.knockoutjs.com) of it. Project is under active development  and looks like a good way to go.
